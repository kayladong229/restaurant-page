# restaurant-page
A simple landing page for a Chinese restaurant. While there is an HTML structure for this website, the majority of content is loaded through DOM manipulation with Webpack's bundling functionality. When one of the three links at the top navbar is clicked, the corresponding information is loaded.

May re-explore experimenting with CSS plugins in the future.
